# Desktop QA matrix

The GitHub Actions Python checks and Intel packaging workflow do **not** verify real radio connectivity or launch behavior on the owner's Mac.

| Feature | Automated verification | Manual verification still needed |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Packet normalization | Unit tests | Different real Meshtastic firmware packet shapes |
| 5,000-row packet window | Headless UI regression tests | Long capture responsiveness |
| Search and node filter | Headless UI regression tests | Keyboard and mouse behavior on Intel Mac |
| Copy Node ID | Headless clipboard test | macOS clipboard integration |
| CSV exports | Syntax/GUI smoke checks | Export paths, permissions, filtered contents |
| Demo mode | Screenshot workflow available | Visual review and screenshot approval |
| TCP connection | Build/import checks only | Live Wi-Fi/TCP radio, loss/recovery, app shutdown |
| Intel Mac packaging | GitHub Actions artifact | Download and launch on physical Intel Mac |

## Before beta
1. Run the automated test workflow and verify the target commit.
2. Run the screenshot workflow; review the generated PNG.
3. Validate the app and TCP radio behavior on actual hardware.
4. Fix failures and record any remaining limitations.
5. Publish a release only with explicit approval.
